/**
   @class PtexHalf
   @brief Half-precision (16-bit) floating-point type.

   This type should be compatible with opengl, openexr, and IEEE 754r.
   The range is [-65504.0, 65504.0] and the precision is about 1 part
   in 2000 (3.3 decimal places).

   From OpenGL spec 2.1.2:

   A 16-bit floating-point number has a 1-bit sign (S), a 5-bit
   exponent (E), and a 10-bit mantissa (M).  The value of a 16-bit
   floating-point number is determined by the following:

   \verbatim
        (-1)^S * 0.0,                        if E == 0 and M == 0,
        (-1)^S * 2^-14 * (M/2^10),           if E == 0 and M != 0,
        (-1)^S * 2^(E-15) * (1 + M/2^10),    if 0 < E < 31,
        (-1)^S * INF,                        if E == 31 and M == 0, or
        NaN,                                 if E == 31 and M != 0 \endverbatim

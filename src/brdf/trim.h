software or derivative works of the contribution in the software.

3. Conditions and Limitations
(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.
(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim
are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the

give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional
consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change.
To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude the

(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.
(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim
are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the
software ends automatically.

Anisotropic Data Files (http://people.csail.mit.edu/addy/research/brdf/)

For standard parameterization, dim[0..3] correspond to [ theta_in, theta_out, phi_diff, phi_in ].
Range: theta_in, theta_out - [0..pi/2],
  phi_in [0..2pi],
  phi_diff - [0..pi] if half_data==1, [0..2pi] if half_data==0.

Bins without (reliable) measurements are filled with negative values
and should be ignored when using the data.

Header format:
Index
0	    dim[0]	Number of bins for the 0th dimension
1	    dim[1]	Number of bins for the 1st dimension
2	    dim[2]	Number of bins for the 2nd dimension
3	    dim[3]	Number of bins for the 3rd dimension
4	    reserved
5	    reserved
6	    paramType	0 - reserved, 1 - Standard Parameterization
7	    binType	0 - Uniform binning, 1 - reserved
8	    reserved
9	    half_data	0 - phi_diff range [0..2pi], 1 - phi_diff range [0..pi]
10	  num_channels	always 3 (RGB)
